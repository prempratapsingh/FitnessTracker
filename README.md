# FitnessTracker
iOS app written purely with Swift code. It doesn't use storyboards or xibs and have complex level of UITableView implementation.

The app uses `MVVM design pattern` for,
1. Creationg and presentation of View, ViewControllers
2. Delegating business logic (data objects, logical calculations, etc) to the ViewModels
3. Data objects are defined as Models

The app uses a `UITableView` to present list of `Excercises` as `UITableViewCells`.Each excercise in the list contains a list of `WorkOuts`.

Users can add/remove Excercies and Workouts at runtime, the UITableView is updated based on the updated list of Excercies and Workouts.

Users can edit the type of Workout as well, doing so instantly updates the related model object and the UITable view to show the latest data states.
